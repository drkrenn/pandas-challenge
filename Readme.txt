The main file used for this assignment and containing all of the relevant syntax is a jupyter file titled "pandaschallenge."

All syntax created for this assignmetn was either self-generated or modified from code generated in class with the exception the following:
- The district summary data frame was generated with the help of a learning assistant. However, no code was specifically given by the learning assistant. The input for that data frame was accidentally being put into a list instead of a dictionary. The learning assistant identified the mistake. 
- The first text to calculate a grouped mean was modified from this website: https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-get-the-average-of-a-groupby-with-pandas/
- The merge functions used were based on syntax  from this website: https://realpython.com/pandas-merge-join-and-concat/#:~:text=pandas%20.join()%20%3A%20Combining%20Data,you%20call%20.join()%20on.
- The syntax for sorting was based on code found on this website: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html
